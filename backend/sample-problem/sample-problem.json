The Koinobori are traditionally displayed during Children's Day celebrations in May to symbolize strength and prosperity. In the foreground, cherry blossoms (sakura) are in full bloom, framing the scene. The background reveals a rural landscape with trees, fields, and a hillside under a blue sky with fluffy white clouds."
